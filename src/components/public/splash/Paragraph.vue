    Our neighborhoods are so much more than just the location of the buildings we live in. Each neighborhood offers something beautiful, inspiring, and entirely unique. However,
    <i>where we live</i> plays a big role in
    <i>how long we live</i>, and the longest- and shortest-lived neighborhoods are separated by
    <i>nearly 20 years</i> in average life expectancy.
    <b>Somos Neighbors</b> connects us with each other, with an understanding of the neighborhoods we live in, and with action to close the life expectancy gap. If we work together we can live long healthy lives in the neighborhoods we love, no matter where in the county we live.
